# WannaDance

# Big idea: 	
Imagine you are at a social event and you bump into someone, how do you prevent any conflict? To settle any issues between the two of you, we can start a dancing game! The game would resemble the famous Dance Dance Revolution Game where users have a dance pad on the ground and start breaking it down! To do this both users will step on the pads at the same time, music will begin to play, and a projector as well as LED lights will tell the two users what pad to dance on. Once they finish they both will be declared a winner.

# Parts Needed:
* LCD Screen
* Paper for dance pads
* Capacitive Sensors
* Projector
* Led lights
* Speaker
* Smart plug
